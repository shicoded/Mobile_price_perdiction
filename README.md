## Introduction
In this project, we use both Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regression to predict the price of mobile phones based on their features. The objective is to compare the performance of these models and determine which one provides better accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes a diverse range of mobile phone specifications and their corresponding prices. It contains features such as brand, RAM size, battery capacity, camera quality, and other relevant attributes that influence the price of a mobile phone. The dataset is sourced from reputable databases and cleaned to ensure high-quality data for training and testing the model.
